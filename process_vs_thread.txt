There are 3 types of concurrecy models
1.Multithreading
2.Multi Processing
3.Async programming


1.Mutithreading
  Are within the same process but concurrently when the cpu schedules every in a very fast manner 
  Such that it gives an illusion that they are simultaneously running
  
  Communication between two or more threads is often faster because the communicate using shared memory
  Threads share the same heap but have their own stack.
 
  Its lightweight and the cpu does not have to provide alot of protection when interleaving threads.
  
  Its also hard to implement it correctly.

  In c++ new threads are created using thread object


2.MultiProcessing
  Are when two or more process are simultaneously running and communicating with each other
  usually using pipe,memory buffers and files.

  Communication is not as fast as threads 

  The cpu has to keep alot of bookeeping in order to make sure that two or more threads do not
  overlap or access each other memory storage
 
  The cpu has PCB (Process control block) where it stores all the proces's stack,heaps and register
  
  Everytime a process interleaves its added to the PCB and everytime a process is schedules again its picked from the PCB.
